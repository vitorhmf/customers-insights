## 1. Abstract:

Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company in Chicago, it has over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. The marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. To that end, she wants to develop marketing strategies aimed at converting casual travelers into annual members.

To do that, however, the marketing team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a subscription, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.


**Disclaimer:** Cyclistic is a fictitious company, according to the context presented in this project.

### 3.1 Context

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the ﬂexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
