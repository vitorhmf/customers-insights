## 1. Abstract:

Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company located in Chicago and has over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. 

The marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. To that end, she wants to develop marketing strategies aimed at converting casual travelers into annual members.

In this way, this project goals to find insights into how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. 

The company's history from September 2021 to July 2022 was analyzed, in a **total of 5,733,030 ride records**, and the conclusions to be presented to the marketing director are available in a dashboard that can be accessed through this link.

### 3.1 Context

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the ﬂexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s ﬁnance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more proﬁtable than casual riders. And now Lily Moreno, the marketing director, has set a clear goal: design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

In this way, this project goals to find insights into how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. This analysis will be done from a dataset that contains 12-month usage records: from September 2021 to July 2022.
